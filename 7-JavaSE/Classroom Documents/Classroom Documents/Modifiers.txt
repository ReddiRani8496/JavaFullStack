Abstract Functions

< Access Specifier > < Access Modifier > <Return Type > < Function Name >( Parameter List);


An Abstract class is a class which can contain one or more abstract Functions

We can't Create an instance of Abstract class
( Throws an Instantiation Exception )

Any class which uses the abstract class its the binded duty of that class to provide the definations of all the abstract methods avaiable.



Interfaces.....

-> It is also similar to that of class

   But only one thing what is differing from  the 
   class ( All the methods are abstract in nature )

-> Use key word implements with interfaces 

-> Your class can implement one or more             interfaces separted by comma.

class MyClass implements Bus,Car

-> Whether we use all the methods are not its our 

   binded duty to provide implementations for all 

   the methods which are in interfaces.
