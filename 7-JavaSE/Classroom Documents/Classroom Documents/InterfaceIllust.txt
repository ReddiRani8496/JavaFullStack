What is an Interface ?

	An Interface is a concept where we have only  the signature of methods.

	Interface contain methods with Only  Declarations ( Abstract Methods )

	Any class which requires our interface to 

	be used.. It should use the concept of 

	implements


	syn

	class < class Name > extends <class Name > implements <Interface 1 >,<Interface 2 >,<Interface 3 >,.......<Interface n >





Interfaces.....

-> It is also similar to that of class

   But only one thing what is differing from  the 
   class ( All the methods are abstract in nature )

-> Use key word implements with interfaces 

-> Your class can implement one or more             interfaces separted by comma.

class MyClass implements Bus,Car

-> Whether we use all the methods are not its our 

   binded duty to provide implementations for all 

   the methods which are in interfaces.

1. A class can extend to another class

2. An interface can extend to another interface



public interface < Interface Name >

{

	// Member Variables
	
	M V are static final and public in nature



	// Member Functions ( Fully Abstract  )

}
